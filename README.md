# Rust crate for local database storage

-# This is a fork of (brudb)[https://github.com/AnasDEV2005/brudb.git]

---

# Functionality:

This crate consists of 2 main structs; `ColumnDB` and `SimpleDB`.  
SimpleDB is a simple 2 column key value storage solution. You can create files, add keys, values delete them, edit them.  
While ColumnDB is for storing data with multiple columns. In addition to what is doable in SImpleDB, you can also add full rows and columns, select a certain range to make a new database, and delete rows or columns.
